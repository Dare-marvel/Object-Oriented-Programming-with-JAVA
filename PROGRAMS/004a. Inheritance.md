### Questions:
1.
Create base class Grandfather with data members name,age,money and method printMoney().

Derive father class From Grandfather class and derive Child class from Father class.

Everytime a child class is created it gets 50% of fathers's wealth.

Accept grandfather's wealth from user and use the child class object to print everyone's

wealth using printMoney().

eg - Gomes(Grandfather) wealth - Rs 50000

Brand(Father) wealth - Rs 25000

Alexa(Child) wealth - Rs 12500

## Explanation:
This Java code is for a program that demonstrates inheritance. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. The `Grandfather` class defines the attributes and methods for representing a grandfather.
2. The `printMoney()` method displays the money of the grandfather.
3. The `Father` class extends the `Grandfather` class and overrides the `printMoney()` method to display the money of the father, which is half of the money of the grandfather.
4. The `Child` class extends the `Father` class and overrides the `printMoney()` method to display the money of the child, which is half of the money of the father.
5. In the `main` method, a `Child` object is created and its `printMoney()` method is called to display the money of the grandfather, father, and child.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) as it performs a fixed number of calculations.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the attributes and local variables.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to represent a grandfather
class Grandfather {
    String name; // Name of the grandfather
    public int age, money; // Age and money of the grandfather

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    public Grandfather(String name, int age, int money) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.money = money;
    }

    // Method to display the money of the grandfather
    void printMoney() {
        System.out.println("Grand Father has rupees:" + money);
    }
}

// Class to represent a father that extends the Grandfather class
class Father extends Grandfather {
    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    public Father(String name, int age, int money) {
        super(name, age, money);
    }

    // Method to display the money of the father
    void printMoney() {
        super.printMoney();
        money = money / 2;
        System.out.println("Father has rupees:" + money);
    }
}

// Class to represent a child that extends the Father class
class Child extends Father {
    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    public Child(String name, int age, int money) {
        super(name, age, money);
    }

    // Method to display the money of the child
    void printMoney() {
        super.printMoney();
        money = money / 2;
        System.out.println("Child has rupees:" + money);
    }
}

public class Inheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the name,age and money of Grandfather:");
        Child c = new Child(sc.next(), sc.nextInt(), sc.nextInt());
        c.printMoney();
    }
}
```

2.
Define parent class "Employee" that has 3 private attributes

String name, String id, int age.

Employee has constructor with 3 arguments that set value of name, id, age.

Class "SalariedEmployee" is a sub class of Employee and has 1 private attribute empSalary and  type.

"SalariedEmployee" can be of type  permanent or on contract and has constructor SalariedEmployee(String name, String id, int age, double empSalary, String Type) to set the values.

constructor SalariedEmployee must call the superclass constructor to set name, id, age and call setter method to set the salary.

Employee salary is empSalary + 2000(allowance) if he is a permanent employee else Employee salary is empSalary (no allowance).

Accept the details of 5 employees and print details of the employee with highest salary.

## Explanation
This Java code is for a program that manages a list of salaried employees and finds the employee with the highest salary. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. The `Employee` class defines the attributes and methods for representing an employee.
2. The `SalariedEmployee` class extends the `Employee` class and adds attributes for the salary and type of the employee.
3. In the `main` method, an array of `SalariedEmployee` objects is created to store data for 5 employees.
4. For each employee, their name, id, age, type, and salary are taken as input.
5. If the employee is permanent (type == 1), their salary is increased by 2000.
6. A `SalariedEmployee` object is created for each employee and their data is stored in the array.
7. The index of the employee with the highest salary is found by iterating over the array of `SalariedEmployee` objects.
8. The details of the employee with the highest salary are displayed.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n) where n is the number of employees as it iterates over the array of `SalariedEmployee` objects once.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(n) as an array of `SalariedEmployee` objects is created to store data for each employee.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

// Class to represent an employee
class Employee {
    String name; // Name of the employee
    String id; // ID of the employee
    int age; // Age of the employee

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    public Employee(String name, String id, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

// Class to represent a salaried employee that extends the Employee class
class SalariedEmployee extends Employee {
    double salary; // Salary of the employee
    int type; // Type of the employee (1 for permanent, 0 for temporary)

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    public SalariedEmployee(String name, String id, int age, int type, double salary) {
        super(name, id, age);
        this.salary = salary;
        this.type = type;
    }
}

public class emp1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        SalariedEmployee se[] = new SalariedEmployee[5];
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Details of Employee:" + (i + 1));
            System.out.println("Enter the name,id,age,type(1/0) [1 for permanent 0 else] and salary of Employee:");
            String name = sc.next();
            String id = sc.next();
            int age = sc.nextInt();
            int type = sc.nextInt();
            double salary = sc.nextDouble();
            if (type == 1) {
                salary += 2000;
            }
            se[i] = new SalariedEmployee(name, id, age, type, salary);
        }
        int m = 0;
        for (int h = 0; h < 5; h++) {
            if (se[h].salary > se[m].salary) {
                m = h;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Employee with highest salary is:" + se[m].name);
        System.out.println("His salary is:" + se[m].salary);
        System.out.println("His age is:" + se[m].age);
        System.out.println("His id is:" + se[m].id);
    }
}
```
