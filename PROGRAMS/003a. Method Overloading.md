### Question:
1.
The payment option on any e-commerce website has several options like netbanking, COD, credit card, etc. That means, a payment method is overloaded several times to perform single payment function in various ways.

To perform the above functionality write a 

class Purchase with 

Data members 

1-item

2- price

3-quantity

Method

1-Billing()------price*quantity

overload payment method according to the type of payement option 

2-payment()----COD----Billing+additional charges Rs.50

3-Payment(Bank name, Account no.)----net banking----billing+1%

4-Payment(Credit card No)-----Credit Card-----billing+2%

write a menu-driven program to perform payment with the following options:

1- COD---default option of payment

2-Netbanking---read bank details from a user

3-Creditcard-read credit card details from a user

## Explanation:
This Java code is for a program that calculates the bill for a group of people making purchases. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. The `Purchase` class defines the attributes and methods for each person making a purchase.
2. The `billing()` method calculates the total bill amount based on the price and quantity of each item.
3. The `billing1()` methods calculate the total bill amount based on the payment method (COD, Net Banking, or Credit Card).
4. In the `main` method, the number of people making purchases is taken as input.
5. An array of `Purchase` objects is created to store the data for each person.
6. For each person, the number of items, item names, item prices, and item quantities are taken as input.
7. A `Purchase` object is created for each person and their data is stored in the array.
8. The payment method is taken as input and the total bill amount is calculated and displayed based on the payment method.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n*m) where n is the number of people making purchases and m is the maximum number of items purchased by any person.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is O(n*m) as an array of `Purchase` objects is created to store data for each person and each `Purchase` object stores arrays of item names, item prices, and item quantities.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to represent a purchase
class Purchase {
    public String[] item; // Array of item names
    public int[] price; // Array of item prices
    public int[] quan; // Array of item quantities
    public float bill = 0.0 f; // Total bill amount

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    Purchase(String[] i, int[] p, int[] q) {
        this.item = i;
        this.price = p;
        this.quan = q;
    }

    // Method to calculate the total bill amount
    public float billing() {
        for (int i = 0; i < item.length; i++) {
            bill += price[i] * quan[i];
        }
        return bill;
    }

    // Method to calculate the total bill amount for COD payment method
    public float billing1() {
        return bill + 50;
    }

    // Method to calculate the total bill amount for Net Banking payment method
    public float billing1(String n, int a) {
        return 1.01 f * bill;
    }

    // Method to calculate the total bill amount for Credit Card payment method
    public float billing1(int i) {
        return 1.02 f * bill;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n, a;
        System.out.println("Enter the number of people:");
        n = s.nextInt();
        Purchase P[] = new Purchase[n];
        for (int h = 0; h < n; h++) {
            System.out.println("Customer number" + (h + 1));
            System.out.println("Enter the number of items:");
            int it = s.nextInt();
            String[] item = new String[it];
            int[] price = new int[it];
            int[] quan = new int[it];
            for (int k = 0; k < it; k++) {
                System.out.println("Name of item:");
                item[k] = s.next();
                System.out.println("Price of item:");
                price[k] = s.nextInt();
                System.out.println("Quantity of item:");
                quan[k] = s.nextInt();
            }
            Purchase g = new Purchase(item, price, quan);
            P[h] = g;

            System.out.println("Enter your choice:");
            System.out.println("1.COD\n2.Net Banking \n3.Credit card\n");
            a = s.nextInt();
            switch (a) {
                case 1:
                    {
                        float z = g.billing();
                        float y = g.billing1();
                        System.out.println("Your bill through COD is:" + y);
                        break;
                    }
                case 2:
                    {

                        System.out.println("Enter the name of bank and account number:");
                        String na = s.next();
                        int an = s.nextInt();
                        float q = g.billing();
                        float w = g.billing1(na, an);
                        System.out.println("Your bill through Net Banking is:" + w);
                        break;
                    }
                case 3:
                    {

                        System.out.println("Enter your credit card number:");

2.
Create a Test class with data double base, int power, int logBase, int argument. 

Create a default, no-argument constructor which sets the default value of all variables to 2.

There are 2 overloaded functions:

1. double calculate (double base, int power)

This function returns the value when *base* is raised to *power*

For example: calculate (3.0, 2) returns the value of 3.0 raised to 2 i.e., 9.0

2. double calculate (int logBase, int argument)

This function returns the value of the log of *argument* to the base *logBase*.

For example: calculate (3, 9) returns log of 9 to the base 3 i.e., 2.0

Create a main method in a separate class to call the above functions with the following inputs:

1. calculate (2, 4)

2. calculate (2.0, 4.0)

Create a display() method which displays the output based on the type of Test object created.

## Explanation
This Java code is for a program that performs mathematical calculations. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. The `Test` class defines the attributes and methods for performing mathematical calculations.
2. The `calculate()` method with two parameters calculates the value of the first parameter raised to the power of the second parameter using the `Math.pow()` method.
3. The `calculate()` method with two parameters of type `double` calculates the logarithm of the second parameter with base equal to the first parameter using the change of base formula.
4. The `display()` method displays the result of a calculation.
5. In the `main` method, a `Test` object is created and its `calculate()` methods are called to perform power and logarithm calculations.
6. The results of the calculations are displayed using the `display()` method.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) as it performs a fixed number of calculations.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the attributes and local variables.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to represent a mathematical test
class Test {
    double base; // Base for power calculation
    int power; // Power for power calculation
    int logBase; // Base for logarithm calculation
    int argument; // Argument for logarithm calculation

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    Test() {
        this.base = 2;
        this.power = 2;
        this.logBase = 2;
        this.argument = 2;
    }

    // Method to calculate the value of base raised to the power of power
    public double calculate(double b, int p) {
        this.base = b;
        this.power = p;
        double val = Math.pow(b, p);
        return val;
    }

    // Method to calculate the logarithm of argument with base logBase
    public double calculate(double lb, double ar) {
        double a;
        double b;
        a = Math.log10(ar);
        b = Math.log10(lb);
        double val = a / b;
        return val;
    }

    // Method to display the result
    void display(double val) {
        System.out.println("The result is " + val);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test t = new Test();
        double u = t.calculate(2, 4);
        t.display(u);
        double sd = t.calculate(2.0, 4.0);
        t.display(sd);

    }
}
```
