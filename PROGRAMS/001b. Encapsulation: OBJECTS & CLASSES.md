### Questions:
1.
An electricity board charges the following rates to demonstrate users to discourage large consumption of energy: 

For the first 100 units – 60 paise per unit. 

For the next 200 units – 80 paise per unit 

Beyond 300 units – 90 paise per unit. 

All users will be charged a minimum of Rs. 50.00. If the total amount is more than Rs. 300 then additional charge of 15% is added. Write a program in Java program to read name of the users and number of units consumed and print out the charges with names


## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be explained in the following points:

1. The code defines an `electricitycal` class that has instance variables for the name of the user and the number of units consumed. It also has a `Scanner` object to take input from the user.

2. The `electricitycal` class has two methods: `infoInput()` and `calculations()`. The `infoInput()` method takes input from the user for the name of the user and the number of units consumed. The `calculations()` method calculates and displays the electricity bill.

3. In the `calculations()` method, the bill is calculated based on the number of units consumed. If the number of units is less than 100, the bill is calculated as units * 0.60. If the number of units is between 100 and 300, the bill is calculated as (units - 100) * 0.80 + 100 * 0.60. If the number of units is greater than 300, the bill is calculated as (units - 300) * 0.90 + 100 * 0.60 + 200 * 0.80.

4. If the bill is greater than 300, a surcharge of 15% is added to the bill.

5. If the final bill amount is less than 50, it is displayed as 50. Otherwise, the final bill amount is displayed.

6. In the `main` method of the `Main` class, an object of the `electricitycal` class is created.

7. The `infoInput()` method is called on this object to take input from the user for the name of the user and the number of units consumed.

8. The `calculations()` method is called on this object to calculate and display the electricity bill.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it takes a constant amount of time to execute regardless of the input size.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

// Class to calculate electricity bill
class electricitycal {
    String name; // Name of the user
    int units; // Number of units consumed
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    // Method to input information about the user and units consumed
    public void infoInput() {
        System.out.println("Enter the name of the user:");
        name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the number of units:");
        units = sc.nextInt();
    }

    // Method to calculate and display the electricity bill
    public void calculations() {
        float bill = 0.0 f;

        // Calculating bill based on number of units consumed
        if (units < 100) {
            bill += units * 0.60 f;
        }
        if (units >= 100 && units < 300) {
            bill += ((units - 100) * 0.80 f + 100 * 0.60 f);
        }
        if (units > 300) {
            bill += ((units - 300) * 0.90 + 100 * 0.60 f + 200 * 0.80 f);
        }

        // Adding surcharge if bill is greater than 300
        if (bill > 300.0 f) {
            bill += bill * 0.15 f;
        }

        // Displaying the final bill amount
        if (bill < 50.0 f) {
            System.out.println("The electricity bill of " + name + " is equal to 50");
        }
        System.out.println("The electricity bill of " + name + " is equal to " + bill);
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating object of electricitycal class
        electricitycal obj = new electricitycal();

        // Inputting information about user and units consumed
        obj.infoInput();

        // Calculating and displaying the electricity bill
        obj.calculations();
    }
}
```

2. Create a Class called library to hold accession number, title of the book, author
name, price of the book and flag indicating whether the book is issued or not. Write a
menu driven program that implements the working of a library. The menu options should
be:

1. Add book information

2. Display book information

3. List all books of given author
 
4. List the books in the order of accession number

## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be explained in the following points:

1. The code defines a `libinfo` class that has instance variables for the name of the book, accession number, name of the author, price of the book, and a flag to check if the book is issued or not. It also has a `Scanner` object to take input from the user.

2. The `libinfo` class has two methods: `infoInput()` and `display()`. The `infoInput()` method takes input from the user for the name of the book, name of the author, accession number, price of the book, and whether the book is issued or not. The `display()` method displays the details of the book.

3. In the `main` method of the `Main` class, three objects of the `libinfo` class are created to represent three books.

4. The `infoInput()` method is called on each of these objects to take input from the user for the details of each book.

5. The code then compares the accession numbers of the three books to find and display their details in ascending order of accession number.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it takes a constant amount of time to execute regardless of the input size.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to store information about a book in a library
class libinfo {
    String b_name; // Name of the book
    int acc_numb; // Accession number of the book
    String a_name; // Name of the author of the book
    int b_price; // Price of the book
    int flag; // Flag to check if the book is issued or not

    // Method to input information about a book
    public void infoInput() {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the title of the book:");
        b_name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the name of the author:");
        a_name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the accesion number:");
        acc_numb = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the price of the book:");
        b_price = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter (1/0) to check whether book is issued or not:");
        flag = sc.nextInt();
    }

    // Method to display information about a book
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("The title of book is " + b_name);
        System.out.println("The accesion number:" + acc_numb);
        System.out.println("The name of the author:" + a_name);
        System.out.println("The price of the book:" + b_price);
        if (flag == 1) {
            System.out.println("The book is issued");
        } else if (flag == 0) {
            System.out.println("Book not issued");
        }
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects for 3 books
