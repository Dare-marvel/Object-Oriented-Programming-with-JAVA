### Questions
```
1.
Create base class Grandfather with data members name,age,money and method
printMoney().
Derive father class From Grandfather class and derive Child class from Father class.
Everytime a child class is created it gets 50% of fathers's wealth.
Accept grandfather's wealth from user and use the child class object to print everyone's
wealth using printMoney().
eg - Gomes(Grandfather) wealth - Rs 50000
Brand(Father) wealth - Rs 25000
Alexa(Child) wealth - Rs 12500
```


## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Grandfather {
    String name;
    int age, money;

    public Grandfather(String name, int age, int money) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.money = money;
    }

    void printMoney() {
        System.out.println(name + " (Grandfather) has rupees: " + money);
    }
}

class Father extends Grandfather {
    int fatherMoney;

    public Father(String name, int age, int money) {
        super(name, age, money);
        this.fatherMoney = money / 2;  // Father inherits 50% of Grandfather's wealth
    }

    @Override
    void printMoney() {
        super.printMoney();  // Print Grandfather's wealth first
        System.out.println(name + " (Father) has rupees: " + fatherMoney);
    }
}

class Child extends Father {
    int childMoney;

    public Child(String name, int age, int money) {
        super(name, age, money);
        this.childMoney = fatherMoney / 2;  // Child inherits 50% of Father's wealth
    }

    @Override
    void printMoney() {
        super.printMoney();  // Print Father's wealth first
        System.out.println(name + " (Child) has rupees: " + childMoney);
    }
}

public class Inheritance {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the name, age, and money of Grandfather:");
        String name = sc.next();
        int age = sc.nextInt();
        int money = sc.nextInt();
        
        // Create a Child object with Grandfather's data
        Child c = new Child(name, age, money);
        c.printMoney();  // This will print the wealth of Grandfather, Father, and Child
    }
}

2.
Define parent class "Employee" that has 3 private attributes
String name, String id, int age.
Employee has constructor with 3 arguments that set value of name, id, age.
Class "SalariedEmployee" is a sub class of Employee and has 1 private attribute
empSalary and type.
"SalariedEmployee" can be of type permanent or on contract and has constructor
SalariedEmployee(String name, String id, int age, double empSalary, String Type) to set
the values.
constructor SalariedEmployee must call the superclass constructor to set name, id, age
and call setter method to set the salary.
Employee salary is empSalary + 2000(allowance) if he is a permanent employee else
Employee salary is empSalary (no allowance).
Accept the details of 5 employees and print details of the employee with highest salary.
