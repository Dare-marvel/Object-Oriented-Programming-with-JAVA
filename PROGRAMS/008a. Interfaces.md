### Questions
```
1.
Write a program to maintain marks of student.
i) Student is Abstract class and it has Roll no., Name, subjectmark attributes.
Showstudentdata() is abstract method. Getstudentdata() is non abstract method.
ii) ISport is an Interface, having attribute sportgracemarks=5. Showsportmark() is a method.
iii) IExServiceMan is an Interface, having attribute ExServiceMangracemarks=10.
ShowExServiceManmark() is a method.
iv) Result is Class and it is inheriting Student, ISport, IExServiceMan.
Totalmarks=subjectmark + sportgracemarks +ExServiceMangracemarks. Showresult() is
method of Result class.
```


## Code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

abstract class Student {
    String name;
    int roll_no;
    int subMarks;
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    void GetStudentData() {
        System.out.println("Enter the name of the student:");
        name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the roll no. of the student:");
        roll_no = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the Subject marks of the student:");
        subMarks = sc.nextInt();
    }

    abstract void ShowStudentData();
}

interface Sport {
    int sportMarks = 5;
    void ShowsportMark();
}

interface ExServiceMan {
    int ExServiceManMarks = 10;
    void ShowExServiceManmark();
}

class Result extends Student implements Sport, ExServiceMan {
    @Override
    public void ShowExServiceManmark() {
        System.out.println("The Ex-Service Man Marks are: " + ExServiceManMarks);
    }

    @Override
    public void ShowsportMark() {
        System.out.println("The sport marks are: " + sportMarks);
    }

    @Override
    void ShowStudentData() {
        System.out.println("The name of the student is: " + this.name);
        System.out.println("The roll no. of the student is: " + this.roll_no);
        System.out.println("The subject marks of the student are: " + this.subMarks);
    }

    void ShowResult() {
        int totalMarks = subMarks + sportMarks + ExServiceManMarks;
        System.out.println("The total marks of the student are: " + totalMarks);
    }
}

public class exp8a1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Result r = new Result();
        r.GetStudentData();
        r.ShowExServiceManmark();
        r.ShowsportMark();
        r.ShowStudentData();
        r.ShowResult();
    }
}

2.
Anand and Krishna are playing a game. This game starts with two piles of n1 and n2
chips. They play alternatively.
In his/her turn a person has to remove one of the piles and split the other pile into two piles,
these two new piles need not be of same size. The person who cannot make a move in his
turn loses. Write a program to find the winner. Here interface Piles has SetPiles(int,int) to set
number of chips in each pile.
```


## Code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner;

interface Piles {
    void setPiles(int n1, int n2);
}

class Game implements Piles {
    private int n1, n2;
    private Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    @Override
    public void setPiles(int n1, int n2) {
        this.n1 = n1;
        this.n2 = n2;
    }

    public void inputPiles() {
        System.out.println("Enter the number of chips in the first pile:");
        n1 = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the number of chips in the second pile:");
        n2 = sc.nextInt();
        setPiles(n1, n2);
    }

    public void play() {
        int turn = 0; // 0 for Anand, 1 for Krishna
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Current piles: " + n1 + " " + n2);
            if (n1 == 0 || n2 == 0) {
                System.out.println((turn == 0 ? "Krishna" : "Anand") + " has won!");
                break;
            }

            // Simulate a move
            if (n1 <= n2) {
                n2 -= n1;
            } else {
                n1 -= n2;
            }

            turn = 1 - turn; // Switch turns
        }
    }
}

public class exp8a {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Game();
        game.inputPiles();
        game.play();
    }
}
```
