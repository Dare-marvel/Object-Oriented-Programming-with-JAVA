Methods of Class

1. Overload the function sum to do the following tasks

1-sum(String author) ---calculating the total count of all books of the given author

2- sum(int acc. no.) --calculating total no of books of the given accession no

## Explanation:
This Java code is for a program that manages a library of books. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. The `library1` class defines the attributes and methods for each book in the library.
2. The `sum()` method with a `String` parameter checks if the author of the book matches the given author.
3. The `sum()` method with an `int` parameter checks if the accession number of the book matches the given accession number.
4. In the `main` method, the number of books in the library is taken as input.
5. An array of `library1` objects is created to store the data for each book.
6. For each book, the accession number, price, author, and title are taken as input.
7. A `library1` object is created for each book and their data is stored in the array.
8. The author whose books are to be searched is taken as input and the number of books by that author is calculated and displayed.
9. The accession number of the book to be searched is taken as input and the number of books with that accession number is calculated and displayed.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n) where n is the number of books in the library as it iterates over the array of `library1` objects twice.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(n) as an array of `library1` objects is created to store data for each book.

## Code:
```java
import java.lang.*;
import java.util.*;

// Class to represent a book in a library
class library1 {
    int a_no; // Accession number of the book
    String title; // Title of the book
    String auth; // Author of the book
    int price; // Price of the book

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    public library1(int a, String t, String au, int p) {
        this.a_no = a;
        this.title = t;
        this.auth = au;
        this.price = p;
    }

    // Method to check if the author of the book matches the given author
    int sum(String au) {
        if (this.auth.equalsIgnoreCase(au)) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    // Method to check if the accession number of the book matches the given accession number
    int sum(int ano) {
        if (this.a_no == ano) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a_no, price;
        System.out.println("Enter the number of Books");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int c = 0;
        int w = 0;
        library1 obj[] = new library1[n];
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            System.out.println("Enter the accesion number of book:" + (k + 1));
            a_no = sc.nextInt();
            System.out.println("Enter the price of book:" + (k + 1));
            price = sc.nextInt();
            sc.skip("\\R?");
            System.out.println("Enter the author's name of book:" + (k + 1));
            String auth = sc.nextLine();
            System.out.println("Enter the title of book:" + (k + 1));
            String title = sc.nextLine();
            obj[k] = new library1(a_no, title, auth, price);
        }

        System.out.println("Enter the author's name whose book you want to search");
        sc.skip("\\R?");
        String aut = sc.nextLine();
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (obj[j].sum(aut) == 1) {
                c++;
            } else {
                continue;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("The number of books of the respective author are " + c);
        System.out.println("Enter the accesion number of the book you want to search:");
        int anno = sc.nextInt();
        for (int h = 0; h < n; h++) {
            if (obj[h].sum(anno) == 1) {
                w++;
            } else {
                continue;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("The number of books of the respective accesion number are " + w);
    }
}

2.
Create a Date class with data int year, int month, int date, int hrs, int min, int sec.
Create a default, no-argument constructor which sets the default date to January 1, 2000,
00:00:00 Create 3 overloaded setter methods

void setDate(int year, int month, int date)

void setDate(int year, int month, int date, int hrs, int min)

void setDate(int year, int month, int date, int hrs, int min, int sec)

Also write a displayDate() method which will display the date depending on the type of
date object created.

add a function calculating the date of retirement at age of 60 for the given input date.

## Explanation
This Java code is for a program that calculates the retirement date of a person based on their date of birth. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. The `date1` class defines the attributes and methods for representing a date.
2. The `setDate()` methods set the date, month, year, hours, minutes, and seconds.
3. The `displaydate()` method displays the date and time.
4. The `retirement()` method checks if a person has retired based on their date of birth and displays their retirement date.
5. In the `main` method, a `date1` object is created and its `setDate()` method is called to set the current date.
6. The current date is displayed using the `displaydate()` method.
7. The date of birth of the person is taken as input and their retirement status and retirement date are calculated and displayed using the `retirement()` method.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) as it performs a fixed number of calculations.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) as it uses a fixed amount of memory to store the attributes and local variables.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to represent a date
class date1 {
    int year; // Year
    int month; // Month
    int hours; // Hours
    int min; // Minutes

    int date; // Date

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    public date1() {
        this.year = 2000;
        this.month = 1;
        this.date = 1;
        this.min = 0;
        this.sec = 0;
        this.hours = 0;
    }

    // Method to set the date, month, and year
    void setDate(int d, int m, int y) {
        this.year = y;
        this.month = m;
        this.date = d;
    }

    // Method to set the date, month, year, hours, and minutes
    void setDate(int d, int m, int y, int h, int mi) {
        this.year = y;
        this.month = m;
        this.date = d;
        this.hours = h;

    }

    // Method to set the date, month, year, hours, minutes, and seconds
    void setDate(int d, int m, int y, int h, int mi, int s) {
        this.year = y;
        this.month = m;
        this.date = d;
        this.hours = h;
        this.min = mi;
        this.sec = s;
    }

    // Method to display the date and time
    void displaydate() {
        System.out.println("The date is:");
        System.out.println("Date:" + (date) + " Month:" + (month) + " Year:" + (year) + " Time" + (hours) + ":" +
            min + ":" + sec);
    }

    // Method to check if a person has retired based on their date of birth
    void retirement(int da, int mo, int ye) {
        if (ye >= this.year + 60) {
            System.out.println("You have retired");
        } else if (ye == this.year + 60) {
            if (mo < this.month) {
                System.out.println("You have not retired yet");
            } else if (mo == this.month) {
                {
                    if (da < this.date) {
                        System.out.println("You have not retired yet");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("You have retired");
                    }
                }
            } else {
                System.out.println("You have retired");
            }
        } else if (ye < this.year) {
            System.out.println("You have not retired");
        }
        System.out.println("Retirement date:" + " Day:" + da + " Month:" + mo + " Year:" + (ye + 60));
