### Problem:
Write a program in Java to maintain the information of Movies which includes the information of :

1-name of movie 

2- type of movie( action , thriller , comedy ,drama ) 

3- Hero name 

4- Heroine 

5- budget in Rs. 

include  method to

1- display this information 

 Q.1 Write a program to accept the information of movies from user and display the same.

Q.2 Create two different objects of the same and Diplay the movie name  having highest budget.

## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be explained in the following points:

1. The code defines a `movie` class that has instance variables for the name, type, hero name, heroine name, and budget of a movie. It also has a `Scanner` object to take input from the user.

2. The `movie` class has two methods: `infoInput()` and `display()`. The `infoInput()` method takes input from the user for the name, type, hero name, heroine name, and budget of a movie. The `display()` method displays the details of the movie.

3. In the `main` method of the `Main` class, three objects of the `movie` class are created to represent three movies.

4. The `infoInput()` method is called on each of these objects to take input from the user for the details of each movie.

5. The `display()` method is called on each of these objects to display the details of each movie.

6. The code then compares the budgets of the three movies to find and display the name of the movie with the highest budget.
 
## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it takes a constant amount of time to execute regardless of the input size.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to store information about a movie
class movie {
    String mname; // Name of the movie
    String tname; // Type of the movie
    String hname; // Name of the hero of the movie
    String hername; // Name of the heroine of the movie
    int budget; // Budget of the movie
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

    // Method to input information about a movie
    public void infoInput() {
        System.out.println("Enter the name of the movie:");
        mname = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the type of the movie:");
        tname = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the name of the hero of the movie:");
        hname = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the name of the heroine of the movie:");
        hername = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter the budget of the movie:");
        budget = sc.nextInt();
    }

    // Method to display information about a movie
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("The details of the movie are:");
        System.out.println("The name of the movie is:" + mname);
        System.out.println("The type of the movie is:" + tname);
        System.out.println("The name of of the hero of the movie is:" + hname);
        System.out.println("The name of of the heroine of the movie is:" + hername);
        System.out.println("The budget of the movie is:" + budget);
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating objects for 3 movies
        movie ob1 = new movie();
        movie ob2 = new movie();
        movie ob3 = new movie();

        // Inputting information for 3 movies
        ob1.infoInput();
        ob2.infoInput();
        ob3.infoInput();

        // Displaying information for 3 movies
        ob1.display();
        ob2.display();
        ob3.display();

        // Finding and displaying the name of the movie with highest budget
        if (ob1.budget > ob2.budget) {
            if (ob3.budget > ob1.budget) {
                System.out.println("The movie with the highest budget is:" + ob3.mname);
            } else if (ob2.budget > ob3.budget) {
                System.out.println("The movie with the highest budget is:" + ob1.mname);
            }

        } else if (ob2.budget > ob1.budget) {
            if (ob2.budget > ob3.budget) {
                System.out.println("The movie with the highest budget is:" + ob2.mname);
            } else if (ob3.budget > ob2.budget) {
                System.out.println("The movie with the highest budget is:" + ob3.mname);

            }
        }
    }
}
```
