1.
Define class Production that has attributes String title, String director, String writer. Production class has 3 argument constructor that sets the values. It also has getter and setter methods and Overridden toString() of object class  to display details of class.

class Play is a sub class of Production with getter and setter methods and has an attribute int performances that is incremented every time a play happens.Add Overridden toString() of object class  to display details of class


class Musical is a Play with songs. Musical object has all attributes of Play as well as String composer and String lyricist along with getter and setter methods. Override toString display all attributes of Musical object


In main create 3 objects of Play and 2 objects of Musical. Every time an object of Play or Musical is created, performances get incremented. Also add the number of seats booked for each play or musical.

Find the total box office collection, provided cost of 1 seat for Play is Rs 500(can be variable) and cost of 1 seat for Musical is Rs 800(can be variable)


Display total No. of performances as 5 and display the box office collection.


Create class Tester with main method.
```

## Explanation:
Define the Production class with attributes title, director, and writer. Implement getter and setter methods and override the toString() method to display the details of the production.
Create the Play class as a subclass of Production. It has an additional static variable performances to track the number of performances. Increment performances in the constructor. Implement getter and setter methods for performances and override the toString() method to include the number of performances.
Define the Musical class as a subclass of Play. It adds two more attributes: composer and lyricist. Implement getter and setter methods for these attributes and override the toString() method to display all the attributes of the musical.
In the main method:
Create objects of Play and Musical with their respective details.
Prompt the user to enter the number of tickets sold for each play or musical.
Calculate the total number of tickets sold by summing the individual ticket counts.
Define the seat costs for Play and Musical.
Calculate the total box office collection by multiplying the ticket counts with the respective seat costs and summing them.
Display the total number of performances using the getPerformances() method.
Display the total number of tickets sold and the total box office collection.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the code is O(1) because the number of iterations and calculations remains constant regardless of the input size. The code performs a fixed number of operations irrespective of the ticket counts or other inputs.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of the code is O(1) because it does not utilize any additional space that scales with the input size. The memory usage is constant as the variables and objects created are fixed regardless of the input.

## Code:
```java

2.
Consider a scenario where Bank is a class that provides functionality to get the rate of interest and withdrawal amount. However, the rate of interest varies according to banks varies and min. balance as per bank is different. For example, 

ICICI-7% rate of interest.

AXIS- 9% rate of interest.

SBI 8% rate of interest.



SBI---MIN. BALANCE required  100

ICICI--MIN. BALANCE required  500

AXIS---MIN. BALANCE required 300

If the amount to withdraw makes available balance less than min. the required balance then print " you don't have enough balance to withdraw"


Print the final amount Ayush will get from that particular bank by applying the rate of interest and period.
```

## Explanation:
The code defines a parent class Bank that contains attributes related to the bank account (amt, w_amt, per, mbal, roi) and methods RateOfInterest() and Withdraw().
There are three child classes: ICICI, SBI, and Axis, which inherit from the Bank class.
Each child class overrides the RateOfInterest() and Withdraw() methods to provide specific implementations for each bank.
The ICICI class sets default values for mbal and roi and calculates the total amount after applying interest in the RateOfInterest() method. The Withdraw() method allows the user to withdraw an amount and updates the account balance accordingly.
The SBI class and Axis class have similar implementations, but with different default values for mbal and roi.
The main method prompts the user to enter their choice of bank, period, and amount.
Based on the user's choice, an object of the respective bank class is created, and the Withdraw() and RateOfInterest() methods are called.
The program displays the appropriate messages based on the user's input.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the code is O(1) because the number of operations and iterations remains constant regardless of the input size. The code performs a fixed number of operations irrespective of the bank choice or the amount being withdrawn.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of the code is O(1) because it does not utilize any additional space that scales with the input size. The memory usage is constant as the variables and objects created are fixed regardless of the input.
