Exercise GradesStatistics : Write a program called GradesStatistics, which reads in n grades (of int between 0 and 100, inclusive) of each student and displays the average, minimum, maximum, median and standard deviation. Display the floating-point values upto 2 decimal places.  Your output shall look like:

Enter the number of students : 4

Enter the grade for students name1 : 50

Enter the grade for students name 2: 51

Enter the grade for students name3  : 56

Enter the grade for students name 4 : 53

{50,51,56,53}

Output:

Display sorted list of objects in increasing order 

The average is 52.50

The Minimum is 50

The Maximum is 56

The Median is : 52.00

Note: 1) The std. deviation is 2.29(formula can be referred from net)
```

## Explanation:
This code is a Java program that calculates the average, median, and standard deviation of grades for a given number of students. It also allows the user to check if a substring is present in student names. Here is the main logic of the code:

1. The `Grades` class is used to store the name and grade of a student. It has a constructor that takes in the name and grade as arguments and initializes the instance variables.

2. The `Calculation` class contains methods to perform calculations on an array of `Grades` objects.

3. The `avcal` method calculates the average of grades by summing up all the grades and dividing by the total number of students.

4. The `sort` method sorts the grades in ascending order using a nested for loop and swapping elements if necessary.

5. The `stddev` method calculates the standard deviation of grades by first calculating the sum of squared differences between each grade and the average, then dividing by the total number of students minus one, and finally taking the square root.

6. The `subcheck` method checks if a given substring is present in student names by using the `indexOf` method on each student's name.

7. The `median` method calculates the median of grades by first sorting the grades, then checking if the total number of students is odd or even, and finally calculating the median accordingly.

8. In the `main` method, the user is prompted to enter the number of students, their names, and their grades. An array of `Grades` objects is created and initialized with this information.

9. A `Calculation` object is created and its methods are called to calculate and print out the average, median, standard deviation, and check for a substring in student names.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) due to the nested for loop in the `sort` method.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is O(n) due to the array of `Grades` objects.

## Code:
```java

2.
Book Ratings : Write a program to find the most popular book.

Create a 2D array named bookRating which should hold ratings( 1 to 5) of a few books. You may consider the first constant reader's rating ( or Scan  and next time as - how many readers have given the rating ?) Collect ratings of four such books. a)Find the average rating of each book. b) Display the most popular book. ie a Book with highest average rating.
```

## Explanation:
This code is a Java program that takes in ratings for 4 books from the user, calculates the average rating for each book, and finds the most popular book based on the average rating. Here is the main logic of the code:

1. The `Book` class contains a 2D array `arr` to store the ratings for 4 books, where each book has 5 ratings. It also contains a static array `avg` to store the average rating for each book.

2. The `input` method takes input from the user for the ratings of each book using a nested for loop.

3. The `avg_rating` method calculates the average rating for each book by summing up all the ratings for that book and dividing by 5. The average is stored in the `avg` array and printed out.

4. The `popular` method finds the most popular book by iterating through the `avg` array and finding the maximum value. The index of this value plus one is the number of the most popular book.

5. In the `main` method, a `Book` object is created and its methods are called to take input from the user, calculate and print out the average ratings, and find and print out the most popular book.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) due to the nested for loops in the `input` and `avg_rating` methods.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the 2D array `arr`.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to store ratings for books and perform calculations
class Book {
    static float avg[] = new float[4];
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    float[][] arr = new float[4][5];

    // Method to take input of ratings from user
    void input() {
        System.out.println("Enter the ratings of 4 books");
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                arr[i][j] = sc.nextFloat();
            }
        }
    }

    // Method to calculate average rating of each book
    void avg_rating() {
        float av = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                av += arr[i][j];
            }
            avg[i] = av / 5.0f;
            System.out.println("The avg rating of book number :" + (i + 1) + " is " + avg[i]);
            av = 0.0f;
        }
    }

    // Method to find the most popular book based on average rating
    void popular() {
        float m = 0;
        int k = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            if (avg[i] > m) {
                m = avg[i];
                k = i;
            }
        }
        System.out.println("The number of most popular book is :" + (k + 1) + " and its average rating is :" + m);
    }
}

// Main class to test the Book class
public class Bookr {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Book b = new Book();
        b.input();
        b.avg_rating();
        b.popular();
    }
}
