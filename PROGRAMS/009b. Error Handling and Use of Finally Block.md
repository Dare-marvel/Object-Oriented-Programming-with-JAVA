### Questions
```
1.
Define a class Cricketer which has:-
Attributes:-
 player_name
 runs_hit
 innings_count
 not_out_count
 batting_avg
Methods:-
 get_avg
Make a cricket team with 11 cricketers. For each cricketer, find his batting average. Handle
all different errors while calculating this. Also make a method which will find the list of
cricketers in ascending order of their batting average and also display the cricketer stats
in this order.
If the average of the batting average of the entire team is less than 20 runs then throw a
user defined exception.
Note- Use the concept of Finallly block, mulitplt catch blocks and handle errors like
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ArithmeticException, ArrayStoreException,
NumberFormatException, etc
```
