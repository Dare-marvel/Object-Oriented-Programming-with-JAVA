1.
odd id program1. Write an abstract class Course with an abstract method
studentDetails().
Create 2 classes Comps and IT which inherits class Course and implements
studentDetails().
The studentDetails() method should print the name, UID, and year (FE, SE, TE) of students
of that Course. These details have to be taken from the user.
Write a program that asks the user to choose a Course and prints details of all students in
that course in a sorted manner as per the year(FE, SE, TE)
```

## Explanation:
1. **Abstract Class `Course`**:
   - This is an abstract class that defines common properties (`name`, `uid`, `year`, `dep`) for all students.
   - It includes an abstract method `printDetails()` that must be implemented by any subclass.

2. **`IT` and `Comps` Classes**:
   - These two classes inherit from `Course` and represent specific departments.
   - Both classes implement the `printDetails()` method to print the details of a student, including department-specific information.

3. **User Input**:
   - The program starts by asking the user for the number of students and then iterates to collect each student's details (name, UID, year, and department).

4. **Course Selection and Object Creation**:
   - Based on the department input (`1` for Comps and `2` for IT), the program creates either a `Comps` or `IT` object for each student and stores them in an array.

5. **Sorting Students by Year**:
   - The array of students is sorted based on their academic year (FE, SE, TE) using `Arrays.sort()` with a custom comparator.

6. **Displaying Details**:
   - The program prompts the user to select a course (Comps or IT) and then displays the details of all students in the selected course, sorted by year.

7. **Output**:
   - Depending on the user's selection, the program filters the students by department and prints their details in a sorted order.

2.
Design a Quiz System as following
There is a abstract class Questions
 It includes a variable question_text- This contains the text of the question
 You can set question text using constructors
 It includes a method verifyAnswer() to verify .
 It includes abstract method specifications for getQuestion(), getSolution()
There are 2 other classes True or False Questions, Multiple Choice Question
 They all inherit the Question class and provide implementation for its methods.
 They all have a variable called mySolution( Note: different class will have different
data type for this variable)
 Child classes will call parents getType method to get the question type
 Multiple Choice Question also has variables for different options
Note:
 Make a Main class where you can make and give the quiz
 Write an interactive program in Java
 Shuffle all the questions randomly
 Each question must specify which type of question it is.
 Total score and solution must be displayed in the end.

```

## Explanation:
1. **Abstract Class `Questions`**:
   - Acts as a base class for all question types.
   - Contains a `question_text` to store the question and an abstract method for getting questions, solutions, and verifying answers.
   - The static variable `marks` keeps track of the user's score.

2. **True/False Questions (`t_f`)**:
   - Inherits from `Questions`.
   - Stores the correct answer and user’s answer.
   - Methods:
     - `getQuestion()` displays the question type and text.
     - `getSolution()` shows the correct answer.
     - `verifyAnswer()` checks if the user's input matches the correct answer or if it's a valid input ("True"/"False"). If incorrect or invalid, it shows the correct answer.

3. **Multiple Choice Questions (`mcq`)**:
   - Inherits from `Questions`.
   - Stores options, correct answer index, and user’s answer.
   - Methods:
     - `getQuestion()` displays the question type, text, and options.
     - `getSolution()` shows the correct option.
     - `verifyAnswer()` checks if the user’s input is a valid option (1-4) and matches the correct answer. If incorrect or invalid, it shows the correct answer.

4. **Main Class**:
   - Creates instances of `t_f` and `mcq`, representing different questions.
   - Adds all questions to a list, shuffles them, and iterates through the list to ask questions.
   - Based on the question type, it prompts the user for an answer and verifies it.
   - If the answer is incorrect or not in the expected format, it marks it wrong and provides feedback.
   - Finally, the total score is displayed.
