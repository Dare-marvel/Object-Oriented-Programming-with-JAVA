### Questions
1.
Create a class named ‘Shape’ which has methods ‘getArea’, ‘getPerimeter’ and ‘getSide’ and
all of them return 0.
Make three subclasses for three different shapes - ‘Circle’, ‘Triangle’ and ‘Rectangle’. These
subclasses inherit the ‘Shape’ class and they have their own ‘getArea’, ‘getPerimeter’, and
‘getSide’ methods definition.
Each of these classes has its own private data members like
The circle will have a Radius,
Triangle will have three sides,
A rectangle will have width and height
Write a program for the above scenario and display the solution.
Note: 1-Solve using method overriding
2- Use Typecasting of objects concept

## Explanation:
Sure! Here's an explanation of the main logic of the code:

1. The code defines a base class `Shape` with methods to set and get the side, area, and perimeter of a shape. These methods are empty or return 0 in the base class.
2. The code then defines three classes that extend `Shape`: `circle`, `Triangle`, and `Rectangle`. Each of these classes overrides the methods in the base class to provide specific implementations for their respective shapes.
3. The `circle` class has a constructor that takes in the radius of the circle and stores it in an instance variable. It overrides the `getSide` method to return the radius, the `getArea` method to return the area of the circle using the formula `πr^2`, and the `getPerimeter` method to return the circumference of the circle using the formula `2πr`.
4. The `Triangle` class has a constructor that takes in the three sides of the triangle and stores them in instance variables. It overrides the `getSide` method to return 3 (since a triangle always has 3 sides), the `getPerimeter` method to return the sum of its sides, and the `getArea` method to return the area of the triangle using Heron's formula.
5. The `Rectangle` class has a constructor that takes in the width and height of the rectangle and stores them in instance variables. It overrides the `getSide` method to return 4 (since a rectangle always has 4 sides), the `getPerimeter` method to return twice the sum of its width and height, and the `getArea` method to return the product of its width and height.
6. The main method creates an array of 3 `Shape` objects, then prompts the user to enter values for a circle, triangle, and rectangle. It creates instances of each shape using these values, then calls their respective methods to print out their side, perimeter, and area.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) since all operations take constant time regardless of input size.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) since only a fixed number of variables are used regardless of input size.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Base class for all shapes
class Shape {
    // Method to set the side of the shape
    void setSide() {}

    // Method to get the side of the shape
    double getSide() {
        return 0;
    }

    // Method to get the area of the shape
    double getArea() {
        return 0;
    }

    // Method to get the perimeter of the shape
    double getPerimeter() {
        return 0;
    }
}

// Circle class that extends Shape
class circle extends Shape {
    double Radius;

    // Override method to get the perimeter of the circle (which is its circumference)
    double getPerimeter() {
        return Math.PI * 2 d * Radius;
    }
}

// Triangle class that extends Shape

    // Override method to get the area of the rectangle
    double getArea() {

2.
The cost of stock on each day is given in an array A[] of size N.

Day 1 price in first location, day 2 price in second location etc. Find all the days on which you buy and sell the stock any number of time so that in between those days your profit is maximum.A new transaction can only start after previous transaction is complete. Person can hold only one share at a time.


Create class Stock that has name of stock and array of prices. Also it has input method that initialises the predicted price of the stock in an array of length N.

Create class Transaction that is sub class of Stock class. It has method findMaximumProfit method.


Example

Stock Prices: {1, 5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 5}

Total profit earned is 10

Buy on day 1 and sell on day 2

Buy on day 3 and sell on day 5

Buy on day 7 and sell on day 8

## Explanation:
he Stock class represents a stock with a name and an array of prices. It provides getter methods to access the name and prices.

The Transaction class extends the Stock class and represents a transaction. It has a method called findMaximumProfit which calculates and prints the maximum profit that can be earned by buying and selling the stock.

The findMaximumProfit method first retrieves the prices array and its length.

It then calls the maxProfit method to find all profitable transactions. The maxProfit method takes the prices array and its length as input and returns a list of Interval objects representing the buy and sell days for each profitable transaction.

The maxProfit method uses the concept of finding local minima and local maxima in the prices array. It iterates through the array and identifies the buy and sell days based on the conditions: a local minima followed by a local maxima. It adds the Interval objects to the transactions list.

Back in the findMaximumProfit method, it checks if the transactions list is empty. If it is, it prints "No transactions found." Otherwise, it calculates the total profit by iterating over the transactions list, calculating the profit for each transaction, and accumulating the profits in the maxProfit variable.

Inside the loop, it prints the buy and sell days for each transaction.

Finally, it prints the total profit earned.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of the code is O(n), where n is the length of the prices array. This is because we iterate over the prices array only once to find local minima and maxima.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of the code is O(k), where k is the number of profitable transactions. We store the buy and sell days for each transaction in the transactions list, which can have at most k elements.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Stock {
    private String name;
    private int[] prices;

    public Stock(String name, int[] prices) {
        this.name = name;
        this.prices = prices;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public int[] getPrices() {
        return prices;
    }
}

class Transaction extends Stock {
    public Transaction(String name, int[] prices) {
        super(name, prices);
    }

    public void findMaximumProfit() {
        int[] price = getPrices();
        int n = price.length;

        List<Interval> transactions = maxProfit(price, n);

        if (transactions.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("No transactions found.");
        } else {
            int maxProfit = 0;
            for (Interval interval : transactions) {
                int profit = price[interval.sell] - price[interval.buy];
                System.out.println("Buy on day: " + (interval.buy + 1) + ", Sell on day: " + (interval.sell + 1));
                maxProfit += profit;
            }
            System.out.println("Total profit earned is " + maxProfit);
        }
    }

    private static List<Interval> maxProfit(int price[], int n) {
        List<Interval> transactions = new ArrayList<>();

        int i = 0;
        while (i < n - 1) {
            // Find Local Minima
            while (i < n - 1 && price[i + 1] <= price[i]) {
                i++;
            }

            if (i == n - 1) {
                break;
            }

            Interval interval = new Interval();
            interval.buy = i++;

            // Find Local Maxima
            while (i < n && price[i] >= price[i - 1]) {
                i++;
            }

            interval.sell = i - 1;
            transactions.add(interval);
        }

        return transactions;
    }

    private static class Interval {
        int buy, sell;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Stock prices on consecutive days
        int[] prices = {1, 5, 2, 3, 7, 6, 4, 2, 10};

        // Create a new transaction object
        Transaction transaction = new Transaction("Stock Name", prices);

        // Find maximum profit and print the results
        transaction.findMaximumProfit();
    }
}

```
