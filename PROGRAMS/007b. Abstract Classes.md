### Questions

1.
The task is to write a Java program in which a user will get K trials to guess a randomly
generated number. Below are the rules of the game:
 If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the program will respond with
the message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number.
 If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number, the program will respond
with the message that the guessed number is lower than the actual number.
 If the guessed number is equal to the actual number or if the K trials are exhausted,
the program will end with a suitable message.
Approach: Below are the steps:
 The approach is to generate a random number using Math.random() method in Java.
 Now using a loop, take K input from the user and for each input print whether the
number is smaller or larger than the actual number.
 If within K trials the user guessed the number correctly, print that the user won.
 Else print that he was not able to guess and then print the actual number.
Define the Player class with an abstract function named getGuess().
Define a class named HumanPlayer derived from Player. Implement abstract method in
this class as getGuess() should prompt the user to enter a number and return the value
entered from the keyboard.
Next, define a class named ComputerPlayer derived from Player. The implementation of
ComputerPlayer::getGuess() should randomly select a number from 0 to 100.
Finally, construct the main function that invokes play(Player &player1, Player &player2)
with two instances of a HumanPlayer (human vs. human), an instance of a HumanPlayer
and ComputerPlayer (human vs. computer), and two instances of ComputerPlayer
(computer vs. computer)
```

## Explanation

1. **Player Class**:
   - Abstract class with the method `getGuess()` which is implemented by its subclasses.

2. **HumanPlayer Class**:
   - Prompts the user to enter a guess.
   - Handles invalid input by catching exceptions and asking the user to enter an integer.

3. **ComputerPlayer Class**:
   - Generates a random guess between 1 and 100.

4. **Main Class**:
   - Contains multiple `play()` methods to handle different combinations of human and computer players.
   - The `check()` method compares the guess with the actual number and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

5. **NumberGuesser Class**:
   - Entry point of the program.
   - Asks the user to choose a game mode (Human vs. Human, Human vs. Computer, Computer vs. Computer, or Solo).
   - Depending on the choice, it calls the appropriate `play()` method from the `Main` class.
   - For solo play, the user has multiple attempts to guess the number, with feedback provided after each guess.

6. **Error Handling**:
   - Ensures that any non-integer input from the user is caught and prompts the user to enter valid input.
   - Ensures that any input outside the expected range results in feedback rather than an exception.
