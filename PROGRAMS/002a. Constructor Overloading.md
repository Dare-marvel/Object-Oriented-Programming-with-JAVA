### Questions:
Write a menu driven program to recruit an employee (depending on his performance in
various rounds) in some software company using constructor overloading.
Selection Criteria for each post is given below: 

1. Programmer(Minimum total of 80 marks ):-
Rounds:-
  a. Course Work
  
  b. Aptitude Test
  
  c. Technical Test
  
  d. Interview
    
2. Team Leader(Minimum total of 85 marks ):-
Rounds:-
  
  a. Technical Test
  
  b. Interview
  
3. Project Manager(Minimum score 90 marks)
Rounds:-
  
  a. Interview
     
Create a class Posting and write 3 constructors to initialize the object and set the
parameters and display the employee post according to selection criteria.
   
   Data members:

• private int courseWork;

• private int AptTest;

• private int TechTest;

• private int interview;

Methods:

• public Posting(int courseWork, int AptTest, int TechTest,int interview)

• public Posting(int TechTest,int interview)

• public Posting(int interview)

Make use of ‘this’ keyword. Create arrray of objects , give the list of candidates selected
for each post(Programmer, Team Lead and project Manager)

## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be explained in the following points:

1. The code defines a `Posting` class that has instance variables for the marks in coursework, aptitude test, technical test, and interview. It also has a variable to store the total marks.

2. The `Posting` class has three constructors: one for the Programmer post, one for the Team Leader post, and one for the Project Manager post. Each constructor takes different arguments based on the post and initializes the instance variables accordingly.

3. The `Posting` class also has a `getMarks()` method that calculates and returns the total marks by adding the marks in coursework, aptitude test, technical test, and interview.

4. In the `main` method of the `Employee1` class, an array of `Posting` objects is created to represent multiple candidates.

5. The code takes input from the user for the number of candidates and their choice of post.

6. Based on the choice of post, the appropriate constructor is called to create an object of the `Posting` class for each candidate.

7. The marks in the respective fields are taken as input from the user and passed as arguments to the constructor.

8. The `getMarks()` method is called on each object to calculate and return the total marks.

9. Based on the total marks and choice of post, it is checked if the candidate is selected or not.

10. If the candidate is selected, a message is displayed accordingly and a counter is incremented to keep track of the number of selected candidates for each post.

11. At the end, the final count of selected candidates for each post is displayed.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n) because it takes linear time to execute based on the number of candidates (n).

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(n) because it uses linear space to store an array of `Posting` objects for n candidates.

## Code:
```java

2. A program to simulate a simple banking system in which the initial balance and rate of
interest are read from the keyboard and these values are initialised using the constructor
member function. The program consists of the following methods:

• To initialise the balance amount and the rate of interest using constructor member function

• To make deposit

• To withdraw an amount

• To find compound interest based on the rate of interest

• To know the balance amount

• To display the menu options

Note:

• Balance cannot be less than 0.

• In a Saving account if minBalance is set then for that the balance cannot go less than that
amount. If it goes, an error must be shown.

• You can set the values by default for the above variables in Checking Account class

## Explanation
The main logic of the code can be explained in the following points:

1. The code defines an `Adetails` class that has instance variables for the initial balance, rate of interest, deposit amount, and withdrawal amount.

2. The `Adetails` class has a constructor that takes the initial balance and rate of interest as arguments and initializes the instance variables accordingly.

3. The `Adetails` class also has methods for depositing an amount, withdrawing an amount, calculating compound interest, displaying the initial balance, and displaying a menu.

4. The `deposit()` method takes the deposit amount as an argument, adds it to the initial balance, and returns the final balance.

5. The `withdraw()` method takes the withdrawal amount as an argument, checks if it is less than or equal to the initial balance, subtracts it from the initial balance if it is, and returns the final balance.

6. The `compound_interest()` method takes the number of years as an argument, calculates and returns the compound interest using the formula A = P(1 + r/100)^n.

7. The `disp_balance()` method returns the initial balance.

8. The `menu()` method displays a menu with options for depositing an amount, withdrawing an amount, calculating compound interest, displaying the initial balance, displaying the menu again, and exiting.

9. In the `main` method of the `Banking` class, an object of the `Adetails` class is created by taking input from the user for the initial balance and rate of interest.

10. A menu is displayed and input is taken from the user for their choice of operation.

11. Based on the choice of operation, the appropriate method is called on the object to perform the operation.

12. If the choice is to deposit or withdraw an amount, input is taken from the user for the amount and passed as an argument to the appropriate method.

13. If the choice is to calculate compound interest, input is taken from the user for the number of years and passed as an argument to the `compound_interest()` method.

14. If the choice is to display the menu again or exit, appropriate action is taken.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(1) because it takes a constant amount of time to execute regardless of the input size.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is also O(1) because it uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size.

    // Constructor to initialize initial balance and rate of interest

        this.rate = rate;
        this.i_balance = i_balance;
