### Questions:
1. Create a four-function calculator for fractions. Here are the
formulas for the four
arithmetic operations applied to fractions:

Addition: a/b + c/d = (a*d + b*c) / (b*d)

Subtraction: a/b - c/d = (a*d - b*c) / (b*d)

Multiplication: a/b * c/d = (a*c) / (b*d)

Division: a/b / c/d = (a*d) / (b*c)

Create the class fraction. Use default constructor to set numerator and
denominator to 1.

a) There are methods to print the four functions for fractions.

b)Program generates a multiplication table for fractions. Let the user
input a
denominator, and then generate all combinations of two such fractions that
are
between 0 and 1, and multiply them together. Here’s an example of the
output if the
denominator is 6:

## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be explained in the following points:

1. The code defines a `Fractions` class that has instance variables for the numerator and denominator of a fraction.

2. The `Fractions` class has two constructors: one with no arguments that initializes the numerator and denominator to 1, and one with two arguments that takes the numerator and denominator as arguments and initializes the instance variables accordingly.

3. The `Fractions` class also has methods for calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing two fractions.

4. The `gcd()` method takes two integers as arguments and returns their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm.

5. The `addition()`, `subtraction()`, `multiplication()`, and `division()` methods take two `Fractions` objects as arguments, perform the respective arithmetic operation on them, and return a new `Fractions` object with the result.

6. In the `main` method of the `Arithmetic` class, two `Fractions` objects are created to represent two fractions.

7. Input is taken from the user for the numerator and denominator of each fraction.

8. The `addition()`, `subtraction()`, `multiplication()`, and `division()` methods are called on these objects to perform the respective arithmetic operations on them and display the results.

9. The code also has a section to print a multiplication table for fractions with a common denominator.

10. Input is taken from the user for the denominator of the fractions in the table.

11. A nested loop is used to iterate over each row and column of the table, calculate the product of the fractions at those positions, and display it in the appropriate cell.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) because it takes quadratic time to execute based on the size of the multiplication table (n). 

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of memory regardless of the input size.

2.
There are 2 classes 'Esselworld’ . In EsselWorld, those above 21 age have an
entry fee of Rs.
1000 and for ages below 21 or above 60 it’s Rs. 700.

Data Members:

● name

● age

● Games[5]

● pass amount

Member functions:

● Default constructor to issue pass by adding games which are included in pass and
assigning age as above 21 with pass amount 1000

● parameterized constructor if age is less than 21 or more than 60
Given:-

● Esselworld has a total of 15 games

● There are some games which are not included in the pass and have some additional
cost. (Note: You can assume games are numbered like Game 1 to 5 out of which first 3
games(Game no 1 to 3) are included in the pass and the rest of the games ( game no 4
to
5) have an extra charge of Rs. 50)

● When the person is going back home, the total number of games that were played and
which were not played must be shown. Also, show the count of the games played.

● On weekends Pass cost is Rs 300 higher compared to the actual cost.

● Also, display the total cost of the person when he is leaving.(extra game
cost+ticket
cost)

● Use an array of objects and give the list of person in descending order of the
amount
paid to Esselworld
Write a program for the above scenario in Java. 

## Explanation
This Java code is for a program that calculates the cost of a pass to EsselWorld for a group of people. Here's the main logic of the code:

1. The `EsselWorld` class defines the attributes and methods for each person visiting EsselWorld.
2. The `data_store()` method takes input from the user for the name, day of visit, age, and number of times each game is played.
3. The cost of the pass is calculated based on the day of visit, age, and number of times certain games are played.
4. In the `main` method, the number of people visiting EsselWorld is taken as input.
5. An array of `EsselWorld` objects is created to store the data for each person.
6. The `data_store()` method is called for each person to take their input and calculate their pass cost.
7. The total number of games played and the net cost of the pass are displayed for each person.
8. The array of `EsselWorld` objects is sorted in decreasing order of pass cost using bubble sort.
9. The sorted list of people and their pass costs is displayed.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) due to the use of bubble sort to sort the array of `EsselWorld` objects.

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity is O(n) as an array of `EsselWorld` objects is created to store data for each person.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Class to represent a person visiting EsselWorld
class EsselWorld {
    String name; // Name of the person
    int numb_Games[] = new int[5]; // Number of times each game is played
    int day; // Day of visit (0 for weekend, 1 for weekday)
    int pass_amount; // Cost of the pass
    int age; // Age of the person
    int sum; // Total number of games played

    // Constructor to initialize the attributes
    EsselWorld() {
        name = "";
        day = 0;
        pass_amount = 1000;
        age = 21;
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            numb_Games[i] = 0;
        sum = 0;
    }

    // Method to take input from the user and calculate the pass cost
    void data_store() {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter name of person:");
        name = sc.nextLine();
        System.out.println("Enter 1 for weekday and 0 for weekend");
        day = sc.nextInt();
        if (day == 0) {
            pass_amount += 300;
        }
        System.out.println("Enter the age: ");
        age = sc.nextInt();
        if (age >= 60 || age <= 21) {
            pass_amount -= 300;
        }
        System.out.println("How many times you have played the games: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            numb_Games[i] = sc.nextInt();
            sum += numb_Games[i];
        }
        pass_amount += 50 * (numb_Games[3] + numb_Games[4]);
    }
}

public class Exp2B {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int n = sc.nextInt();
        EsselWorld[] z = new EsselWorld[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            z[i] = new EsselWorld();
            z[i].data_store();
            System.out.println("Total number of number of Games played: " + z[i].sum);
            System.out.println("Net Cost of Pass = Rs." + z[i].pass_amount);
        }
        EsselWorld temp = new EsselWorld();
        // Sort the array of EsselWorld objects in decreasing order of pass cost using bubble sort
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {
                if (z[j].pass_amount < z[j + 1].pass_amount) {
                    temp = z[j];
                    z[j] = z[j + 1];
                    z[j + 1] = temp;
                }
            }
        }
        System.out.println("List of people and their cost in decreasing order: ");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.println(z[i].name + "\t" + z[i].pass_amount);
        }
    }
}
