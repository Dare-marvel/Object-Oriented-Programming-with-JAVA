## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be summarized in the following points:

1. The code defines a class named `items` which contains a 3D array of integers, a Scanner object, and several methods.
2. The `input` method reads input from the user to populate the 3D array. The first two dimensions of the array represent the cart number and item type (perishable or non-perishable), respectively. The third dimension represents the items themselves.
3. The `tot_cal` method calculates and displays the total cost of each cart by summing up the values of all items in each cart.
4. The `Per` method displays all perishable items in each cart.
5. The `cost_nonper` method finds and returns the costliest non-perishable item among all carts.
6. The `main` method creates an instance of the `items` class, calls its methods to read input from the user, calculate and display the total cost of each cart, display all perishable items in each cart, and find and display the costliest non-perishable item among all carts.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the total number of items in all carts. This is because all methods that involve looping through the 3D array have a time complexity of O(n). 

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is also O(n) because it uses a 3D array to store all items in all carts.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*; // Importing the java.util package

class items{ // Defining a class named 'items'
    Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in); // Creating a Scanner object to read input from the user
    int n; // Declaring an integer variable 'n'
    int arr [][][] = new int [3][2][]; // Declaring a 3D array of integers with size 3x2xundefined

    void input(){ // Defining a method named 'input' to read input from the user
        for(int i=0;i<3;i++){ // Looping through the first dimension of the array
            for(int j=0;j<2;j++){ // Looping through the second dimension of the array
                System.out.println("Enter number of items of type:"+(j+1)+"cart"+(i+1)); // Prompting the user to enter the number of items
                int n= sc.nextInt(); // Reading the number of items from the user
                arr[i][j]= new int [n]; // Initializing the third dimension of the array with size 'n'
                for(int k=0;k<n;k++){ // Looping through the third dimension of the array

            for(int k=0;k<arr[i][0].length;k++){ // Looping through only perishable items (second dimension index is 0)
                System.out.println(arr[i][0][k]); // Displaying each perishable item
            }
        }
    }

2.
Your country is at war and your enemies are using a secret code to communicate with each other. You have managed to intercept a message that

reads as follows:

:mmZ\dxZmx]Zpgy



The message is obviously encrypted using the enemy’s secret code. You have just learned that their encryption method is based upon the ASCII code. 

 For example, the letter “A” is encoded using the number 65 and “B” is encoded using the number 66.

Your enemy’s secret code takes each letter of the message and encrypts it

as follows:

If (OriginalChar + Key > 126) then

EncryptedChar = 32 + ((OriginalChar + Key) – 127)

Else

EncryptedChar = (OriginalChar + Key)

For example, if the enemy uses Key = 10 then the message “Hey” would be

encrypted as:

Character ASCII code

______________________

H 72

e 101

y 121

Encrypted H = (72 + 10) = 82 = R in ASCII

Encrypted e = (101 + 10) = 111 = o in ASCII

Encrypted y = 32 + ((121 + 10) – 127) = 36 = $ in ASCII

Consequently, “Hey” would be transmitted as “Ro$.”

Write a program that decrypts the intercepted message. You only know that the key used is a number between 1 and 100. Your program should try to decode the message using all possible keys between 1 and 100.

When you try the valid key, the message will make sense. For all other keys, the message will appear as gibberish.



Q1. Input a sentence . Encrypt it using above given logic and display the same 

Q.2. Follow the decryption of the encrypted text . it shoulsd generate the original message back

Q.3. If that sentence contains " lock" this sub string 3 times then print message  " welcome to group"

otherwise  "you may leave"

## Explanation:
The main logic of the code can be summarized in the following points:

1. The code defines a class named `enc` which contains a String variable, a Scanner object, and several methods.
2. The `in` method reads input from the user to populate the String variable.
3. The `code` method encrypts the string entered by the user by adding 10 to the ASCII value of each character. If adding 10 to the ASCII value of a character exceeds 126, it wraps around and adds the remaining value to 32.
4. The `lock` method checks if the user is allowed to join a group or not. However, the logic of this method is flawed and doesn't make sense. It checks if the index of the substring "lock" in the string entered by the user is equal to 1, increments a counter variable if it is, and then checks if the counter variable is divisible by 3 and not equal to 0. If it is, it displays a message indicating that the user is welcome to join the group, otherwise it displays a message asking the user to leave.
5. The `main` method creates an instance of the `enc` class, calls its methods to read input from the user, encrypt the string entered by the user, and check if the user is allowed to join a group or not.

## Time and Space Complexity:
### `Time Complexity`:
The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the length of the string entered by the user. This is because all methods that involve looping through the string have a time complexity of O(n).

### `Space Complexity`:
The space complexity of this code is also O(n) because it uses a character array of size equal to the length of the string entered by the user.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Importing the Scanner class from the java.util package

class enc{ // Defining a class named 'enc'
    Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in); // Creating a Scanner object to read input from the user
    String str; // Declaring a String variable 'str'

    void in(){ // Defining a method named 'in' to read input from the user
        System.out.println("Enter your string:"); // Prompting the user to enter a string
        str=sc.next(); // Reading the string from the user
    }

    void code(){ // Defining a method named 'code' to encrypt the string entered by the user
        char encode []= new char[str.length()]; // Declaring a character array of size equal to the length of the string
        for(int i=0;i<str.length();i++){ // Looping through each character of the string
            if(str.charAt(i) + 10>126){ // Checking if adding 10 to the ASCII value of the character exceeds 126
                encode[i]= (char)(32+(str.charAt(i)+10)-127); // If it does, wrapping around and adding the remaining value to 32
            }
            else{
                encode[i]=(char)(str.charAt(i)+ 10); // If it doesn't, simply adding 10 to the ASCII value of the character
            }
        }
        System.out.println("Your encrypted string is:"); // Displaying a message indicating that the encrypted string is being displayed
        for(int j=0;j<str.length();j++){ // Looping through each character of the encrypted string
            System.out.print(encode[j]); // Displaying each character of the encrypted string
        }
        System.out.println(); // Printing a newline character
    }

    void lock(){ // Defining a method named 'lock' to check if the user is allowed to join a group or not
        int a=0; 
        if(str.indexOf("lock")==1){ 
            a++; 
        }
        if(a%3==0 && a!=0){ 
            System.out.println("welcome to group"); 
        }
        else{
            System.out.println("please leave"); 
        }
    }
}

public class encrypt { 
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        enc e= new enc(); 
        e.in(); 
        e.code(); 
        e.lock(); 
    }
}
```
